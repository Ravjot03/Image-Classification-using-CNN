# Image Classification using CNN

This project shows comparison between Artificial Neural Networks (ANN's) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) on the popular CIFAR-10 Image Classification dataset.

## Dataset Overview:
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely-used dataset for machine learning and computer vision tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes are airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. This jupyter notebook explores the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
